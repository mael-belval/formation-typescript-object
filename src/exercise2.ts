/**
 * Exercise 2
 * 
 * 1. Copy the class Fraction from exercise 1 or export it from exercise1.ts
 * 
 * 2.   Create a class FractionError that extends the class Error. It should have a constructor that takes a message as
 *      parameter. Set the name of the error to "FractionError".
 * 
 * 3.   Modify the class Fraction to throw a FractionError if the denominator is 0 when the fraction is created or when
 *      the setter is called with a denominator of 0.
 * 
 * 4. Test your class with a try/catch block.
